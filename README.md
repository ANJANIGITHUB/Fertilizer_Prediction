This is Fertilizer Prediction Model

Step 1: Import all the required Libraries.Since i am using Machine Learning and Deep Learning in same file i have imported all the required libraries for the same.
Step 2: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Step 3: Perform Feature Engineering on all the Features.
Step 4: separate Training and Test set.
Step 5: Applied Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning(ANN) Approach.
Step 6: Logistic Regression is giving Accuracy 77%, Support Vector Machine giving accuracy only 41 % and 
         Deep Learning is giving the highest Accuracy around accuracy: 80 %
Step 7: We should choose Deep Learning (ANN) for this data set.
